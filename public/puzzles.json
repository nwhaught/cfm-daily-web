      "question": "What does it mean to have a knowledge of the gospel?",
      "response": "There are two senses in which we might have a knowledge of the gospel. The first sense is more of a box-ticking exercise that applies to things like the performance of ordinances and believing in the literal name of Christ. The second sense is more about the knowledge of the truth as we seek it, live it, and apply it. \n\n The Lord is saying here that the first sense doesn't matter all that much, and that even the second sense is mediated by the principle that where much is given, much is required."

      "response": "Think about a thing that you WANT to do or be, but haven't yet been able to accomplish. Does that gap between wanting and being feel a bit like a bondage? I don't know what we'll experience in the spirit world, but in this life, until I can EMBODY the things that my spirit desires, I feel as though I am in bondage. \n\nRepentance and resurrection go hand in hand.
