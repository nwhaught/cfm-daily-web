Satan teaches us to control, to dominate, and to force at every opportunity. When we think about \"worshipping God\" we generally think about church and the temple, and when we think about \"worshipping Satan\", we generally think about occult rituals and things you might see in a horror movie, but worshipping is much more about which methodolgy you choose in your efforts. \n\nIn Norwegian, the verbs for \"to pray\" and \"to ask\" are the same word: \"å be\", and the word for \"worship\" is closely related: \"å tilbe\", or to \"pray to\". So, to worship means to pray to, or to make a request.

I think that's true, but for it to work faith can't just mean believing harder than our fear. Faith is about consistency, and doing the little things every time, even when you're not sure they're going to work.

For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air;",
      "question": "What might it mean to create something spiritually? What does that have to do with us participating with God in creating our own lives?",
      "response": "Creating something spiritually means both planning for something, and also creating the circumstances were you can turn it into a reality. Mom and I created this family spiritually before we created it physically. We did this by preparing and getting married in the temple, by learning to provide for our children, and by raising you in a way that helped you turn into the wonderful people you are. We are still creating, both phyically and spiritually. You can begin creating your life spiritually by planning and preparing now for the kind of life you want to have in the future."

      "response": "We have 3 different versions of the creation story in the scriptures. 1 in Genesis, 1 in Moses, and 1 in Abraham. There is one more version in the temple. They are all very similar to each other, but they each have differences. One difference in the temple version is that while Heavenly Father is directing, it is Christ, working together with Adam, (who we're told in the temple represents all of us) who does the actual work. \n\nGod showed Abraham the spirits that existed before the world was created, and said that there were many \"noble and great ones\". Hopefully we are among that number. We are children of God--what does that make us?"

If we want to do that for more than a single generation, children are needed, but more important is that our purpose is not to make MORE people, it's to make BETTER people.

      "question": "How does Satan still seek to destroy our agency?",
      "response": "In order to truly exercise agency, you need 4 things:\n1. A correct understanding of what your choices will get you.\n 2. Some emotional stake in the outcome. If you don't care what happens, you are not acting as an agent.\n 3. A true choice--if you're being presented with a false choice, you don't truly have any agency.\n4. The ability to change. (ie, to do something different this time than you did last time.\n\nIf that's true, then how might Satan try to destroy agency?\n1. He confuses and hides the consequences of right and wrong, generally by taking advantage of the fact that some consequences are immediate and others are delayed.\n2. He ncourages apathy in the face of complexity or challenge.\n3. He will try to convince us that all roads lead us to the same place, or that nothing we do will matter.\n4.
